P: The total number of PCR tests performed as of yesterday in the United States.
S: 
there are 56 unique state/state_fips/state_name
for each state fip, there are only three unique overall_outcome
    Positive, Negative, Inconclusive 
we need to calculate the latest value of total_results_reported for each state fip



P: The 7-day rolling average number of new cases per day for the last 30 days.
S:
The "change in daily cases in last 7 days" column uses the seven-day average of new cases on the most recent full day of data to calculate 
the percent change compared to the average a week before.
New cases per day.
7-day average of new cases per day (7-day average = new cases per day for the last 7 days)
7-day rolling average number of new cases per day for the last 30 days
    it takes the last 7 days, adds them up, and divides it by 7 for the last 30 days of data

create a new dataframe and apply rolling panda on it
intent: is to show that person has seen data as raw and transformed it appropriately to make it easy to work with


P: The 10 states with the highest test positivity rate (positive tests / tests performed) for tests performed in the last 30 days.
no of Positive testcase in last 30 days for each state/ last 30 days of new_results_reported
